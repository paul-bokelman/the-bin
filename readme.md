A fast way to jot down and gather ideas. The bin has not statistically been proven to do anything beneficial to your work flow but the colors are pretty.

## Installation Guide

1. Clone repo and place in desired location.
2. Go into directory and run `npm run bin`
Thats it!

Note: 
You can also make an alias in your .zsh file to call the-bin globally and quickly. Mine looks like this: `alias bin="npm --prefix ~/desktop/code/the-bin run bin"`.
